# Web server

Web server based on React-APP, Node.js express and Flask for Python API.

### Set Up

Clone the repository.

```shell
git clone <url>
```

Now build the react-app.

```bash
# install react-app and build it
cd react-webapp/react-app
npm install
npm run build

# copy build directory to express-app directory
cp -R /build/* ../express-app/build
```

### Run with Docker

Just run the docker-compose on your local machine.

```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Manual set up

Run the bash script to configure the .env files

```shell
bash configure_server.sh
```

Now its time to install all dependencies.

Prerequisites: Node, Python 3, Linux

```shell
# install dependencies for node.js express server
cd ../express-app
npm install
```

We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) to install the Flask API.

```shell
cd ../fifa-api

poetry install
poetry run python api.py

# run "gunicorn gettingstarted.wsgi" if you are on linux and want to use flask for production
```

Now we can go back to our node.js app and run it in our network.

```shell
cd ../express-app
npm run start
```

### Nginx

Make sure that you have configured your firewall correctly to allow incoming requests from your network.
You can use some useful links and commands in the install guide file. IÂ´ve linked some articles which explain how you can set up a nginx reverse proxy to deploy the server on your local network.
